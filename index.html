						<p >According to Stanford Researcher, John McCarthy, “Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Artificial Intelligence is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.” </p>

				<h3>How AI Is Going to Drastically Change the Future of the Automotive Sector?</h3>
				<p>Artificial intelligence has had a dramatic impact on the efficiencies of daily human tasks as well as complex intellectual tasks that require substantial human intelligence. AI is taking over the automotive industry as well, handling the reins in every department ranging from designing and manufacturing cars to car maintenance, safety, and AI-enabled cockpits. Self-driving cars like 2021 Tesla Model S are now a reality, thanks to the rapid advancements in AI technologies over the years.</p>
				<h3>AI-Powered Cabin</h3>
				<p>Over the course of fifteen years, cars have experienced connectivity in the form of cellular modems in the more advanced vehicles to the high-tech 4G Wi-Fi connectivity that you would find in most cars today. Today, AI has taken over the automotive world for vehicles of all price ranges. AI controls almost every aspect of your cockpit, enabling you to personalize, interact with in-car assistants like Alexa or Google, monitor your driving patterns, and access the latest systems to simplify driving.</p>
				<h3>Autonomous Driving</h3>
				<p>The dream of fully autonomous cars roaming freely on the streets feels straight out of a sci-fi movie. However, this dream is edging closer to reality as we encounter gradual ramp-ups in the level of automation of self-driving cars. Still, autonomous cars practically require some level of human intervention. The trust factor among the customers regarding self-driving technologies is still under construction. Currently, there exist 5 levels of Advanced Driver Assistance systems in the industry, with the last level even removing the necessity of a steering wheel from the equation.</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				<p>AI has changed the way we percept our daily ride-on-wheels. AI has almost breathed life into our daily rides, as our cars continuously adapt to the changes of our surroundings even while in motion. Self-driving cars are now a real prospect, as more and more customers place trust in the AI algorithms behind its driving.</p>

			<h1 style="  border: 5px solid #11ceee;">  FACE DECTION  AND  RCOGNITION</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="sss">
	<p>Face recognition from image or video is a popular topic in biometrics research. Many public places usually have surveillance cameras for video capture and these cameras have their significant value for security purpose. It is widely acknowledged that the face recognition have played an important role in surveillance system as it doesn't need the object's cooperation. The actual advantages of face based identification over other biometrics are uniqueness and acceptance. As human face is a dynamic object having high degree of variability in its appearance, that makes face detection a difficult problem in computer vision. In this field, accuracy and speed of identification is a main issue.
The goal of this paper is to evaluate various face detection and recognition methods, provide complete solution for image based face detection and recognition with higher accuracy, better response rate as an initial step for video surveillance. </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Face detection and recognition process</h2>
<p>The facial recognition process begins with an application for the camera, installed on any compatible device in communication with said camera. The application is programmed in Golang, and works with both Raspbian and Ubuntu as a local console app. When the application is first launched, it requires being configured using a JSON config file with Local Camera ID and Camera Reader type.
This application is then able to use computer vision and a deep neural network in order to find a prospective face within its stream. There are two primary effective ways to do so: The first is the TensorFlow object detection model and the second is Caffe face tracking. Both these methods have functioned well, and are a part of the OpenCV library.
API requests within the solution use RESTful API, and back end employee data collection uses MongoDB Collections and Golang. It would be possible to use a regular workstation setup to test the solution.
It’s important to note that supporting security measures can and probably should enhance facial recognition. An image of a face is far easier to obtain than a retinal scan or fingerprints. If the security needs are vital enough, taking extra face anti-spoofing measures ensure that no one is able to defeat a facial recognition system with a photograph or image of a face.
